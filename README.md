# Week2-Project

In this week's project, I have been asked to create an image gallery that includes acccesbility features for screen readers and other requirements. I have completed the basic requirements and have achived one strecth goal.

Starting with the basic requirements, The media queries and alt text attributes I found the easiest but he event handlers I had trouble with. I feel like JavaScript will be my weakpoint during this course but I feel like that could change because hey! it's only the end of week 2 ( start of week 3 when you're marking this!). I overcame the trouble I was having by re watching the lesson we had on events in js to re Jog my memory , I also looked online on MDN. Once I got my images on the page I got into the flow of what I needed to do next.

In the stretch requiremnts, I managed to adapt my webpage on multiple devices. I achived that be setting the min-widths to 600 and 400px , I made sure it worked by asking some family and friends to go onto the webpage to test it out and it worked really well.

The only thing I found difficult in this project was wondering where to start writing my javascript to function on my webpage. Like I said Javascript is still a bit new and scary to me. I asked my classmates on where to start in the class discord and someone gave me really good advice they said go with these steps:
1 - sort your url's and alts
2- create your function
3-stick in the dom dont look at the other stuff yet, just get the images on the DOM so you can see it
then you can work from there
Thats how I went through it. If you look at all the other code it gets too much and its confusing
dont forget to call the function after you have appended.

After reading that I got the ball rolling then, If possible could I get feedback on my code , thank you!
